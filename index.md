# About Me

Hey there, welcome to my blog. I like to consider myself a Web Engineer, focusing my mind on WordPress development. I have co-founded
[iPanelThemes Web Solutions Pvt. Ltd.](https://ipanelthemes.com) with my good friend [Akash Ghosh](http://akashghosh.me).

WordPress Theme and Plugin development are two of my strongest skills. It needlessly explains my proficiency in PHP, MySQL, jQuery/JS, CSS and HTML.

Apart from WordPress, I also like to find my way around System Administration stuff, like installing and managing full LAMP stack. You can
read more about it in my first blog [inTechGrity](http://www.intechgrity.com).

When I am not doing these things, I am usually playing with my buddy Scooby, or riding my Motor Cycle or just out having fun.
